            As with all water purification devices, the decision to buy any
            product should be based on how that product will impact water
            quality. That is, decide what you need to fix in your water, and
            then start looking for a product to solve your problem.

              Not all water filtration or purification devices are created
              equal. Some products are designed to remove sediment, while some
              products will remove chemicals from the water.

              In the case of a UV system, it is the latter. Anybody who is
              concerned about possible or proven microbiological contamination
              in their drinking water should consider a UV system. Do not look
              to UV to remove any chemicals from water nor to improve the taste
              and odour of the water. It simply isnâ€™t designed for this.
